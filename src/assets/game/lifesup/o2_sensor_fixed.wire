; O2 SENSOR - Oxygen Level Sensor Interface (FIXED VERSION)
; This is the correct implementation for reference

module o2_sensor(analog:8, clk) -> level:8:
  ; Sample the analog input on clock edge for stability
  sampled = dff8(analog, clk)

  ; Output all 8 bits of the sampled level
  level = sampled[0:7]
